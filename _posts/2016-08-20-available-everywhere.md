"Once a quantum particle interacts or...'entangles' with another particle, no matter how many miles apart they are ...(non local), their mechanical states remain coupled. If...one particles rotational spin is clockwise, it's entangled twin's rotational spin is the opposite, counterclockwise...No matter how much distance separates them, when...one particles spin changes...it's twin changes simultaneously as well, even if one is in Paris and the other is in Beijing."

Bruce H Lipton PhD, The Honeymoon Effect

This means that when a practitioner's intention is to work with and heal (change the energy of) their client, the client will be affected immediately by the practitioners' intention regardless of the distance between them.
